// ## **Part 1: Number Facts**

// 1. Make a request to the Numbers API (http://numbersapi.com/) to get a fact about your favorite number.
//      (Make sure you get back JSON by including the ***json*** query key, specific to this API. [Details](http://numbersapi.com/#json).
// 2. Figure out how to get data on multiple numbers in a single request.
//      Make that request and when you get the data back, put all of the number facts on the page.
// 3. Use the API to get 4 facts on your favorite number.
//      Once you have them all, put them on the page. It’s okay if some of the facts are repeats.

//     *(Note: You’ll need to make multiple requests for this.)*

fetch("http://numbersapi.com/300?json")
  .then((response) => (json = response.json()))
  .then((json) => console.log(json))
  .catch(console.error);
